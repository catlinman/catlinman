# Heya! #

Hey I'm Catlinman but you can call me Cat. I create everything from artworks, animations, video games and music to open source tools and an unhealthy amount of application theming configurations here on GitHub.

As of 2020 I am no longer active under this handle. It's been a ride and it's time to move on to newer adventures! [@zealsprince](https://github.com/zealsprince)

_You'll probably still see me committing to some of my legacy repositories once in a blue moon, but don't count on it!_
